# WCAG Accessibility Checker

A lightweight web accessibility checker that analyzes websites for WCAG compliance using puppeteer-core and @sparticuz/chromium.

## Features

- Lightweight implementation with bundle size under 50MB
- Serverless compatible with @sparticuz/chromium
- Comprehensive WCAG accessibility testing
- Screenshot capture of accessibility issues
- Export results to Excel
- Detailed reporting and issue prioritization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wcag-checker.git
cd wcag-checker
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Using in Production (Serverless)

This tool is optimized for serverless environments using `@sparticuz/chromium` and `puppeteer-core`. The implementation automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate browser configuration.

For AWS Lambda or other serverless deployments, no additional configuration is needed as the code automatically uses the lightweight Chromium build.

## Compliance Standards

The tool supports the following compliance standards:

- WCAG 2.0/2.1 Level A
- WCAG 2.0/2.1 Level AA
- WCAG 2.0/2.1 Level AAA
- Section 508
- Best Practices

## Implementation Details

- Uses puppeteer-core instead of full Puppeteer to reduce bundle size
- Implements @sparticuz/chromium for serverless environments
- Automatically detects the runtime environment to use the appropriate browser configuration
- Combines results from multiple analysis methods for comprehensive testing

## Bundle Size Optimization

The implementation is optimized to keep the bundle size under 50MB by:

1. Using puppeteer-core instead of full Puppeteer
2. Using @sparticuz/chromium which is a lightweight Chromium build
3. Loading browser only when needed
4. Avoiding large dependencies
